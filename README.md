A repo of all Natural Language Processing assignments completed as coursework. (CMI) - 2023 

1st assignment deals with creating a simple n-gram counter on a dataset storing word prediction probabilities using a basic frequentist approach.

2nd assignment deals with word similarity. Cosine distance has been used as a measure. Principal Component analysis is done once word vectorisaiton is done, to apply similarity 
measures on 2D word vecs. 

3rd assignment deals with training a LSTM on a corpus. Sequential inputs are taken and fed into the data, such that for a given abstract, corresponding text is generated.
